[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/cwzou/mongo-rdkit/_apis/build/status/rdkit.mongo-rdkit?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/cwzou/mongo-rdkit/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

<a href="https://github.com/rdkit/mongo-rdkit">Mongo-rdkit</a> is an integration between MongoDB, 
a NoSQL database platform, and RDKit, a collection of cheminformatics and machine-learning software.
This package contains tools to create and manipulate a chemically-intelligent database, as well as
methods for high-performance searches on the database that leverage native MongoDB features.

folder on GitHub.

## Installation

### macOS and Linux:
Ensure that you have either Anaconda or Miniconda installed and that `conda` has been added to `PATH`.

Clone the repository into your desired directory.

Navigate so that your current working directory is `mongo-rdkit`.

Create a conda environment called mongo_rdkit that includes all dependencies needed for this package: 
```
conda env create --quiet --force --file env.yml
```
Activate said conda environment:
```
source activate mongo_rdkit
```
Install a local copy of mongo-rdkit by running this from the same directory as `setup.py` (`mongo-rdkit` is not yet published to PyPI):
```
pip install -e .
```

You can now `import mongordkit` in your Python interpreter or run all tests using the `pytest` command.

### Windows:
Similarly, ensure that `conda` has been added to `PATH`.

Clone the repository into your desired directory and navigate into it.

Create a conda environment called mongo_rdkit that includes dependencies:
```
conda env create --quiet --force --file env.yml
```
Activate this conda environment: 
```
call activate mongo_rdkit
```
Check that you are able to import mongordkit:
```
python -c "import mongordkit"
```
If this fails, you may need to add the current directory manually to `PYTHONPATH`:
```
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:.
```
You can now use `mongordkit` in your interpreter and run tests using `python -m pytest`.
## Package Contents
### Modules
`mongordkit` contains two main modules, each of which contains a variety of importable methods and classes.
`Database` contains functionality for writing and registering data. `Search` contains functionality for setting up and performing
substructure and similarity search. Detailed walkthroughs can be found in the notebooks, listed below.
